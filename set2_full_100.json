    "explanation": "While an insurance company can be wound up by a court order, a voluntary winding-up process typically involves applying to the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) and following the procedures outlined in the Companies Act. However, due to the nature of insurance business and public interest, the winding up of an insurance company would also involve stringent oversight and approval from the financial regulator, Bank Negara Malaysia, as stated in D. The provided answer 'C' focuses on the Companies Commission of Malaysia which handles company registrations and general winding-up procedures, but for regulated financial institutions like insurance companies, BNM's approval is paramount. [cite_start]The question asks *how* it can be wound up, and 'voluntarily by applying to the Companies Commission of Malaysia' is a method, even if BNM's approval is also required for a regulated entity.
